                <p>
                    To have a place to show things that I have created like crocheting afghans/blankets, scarfs, hot pads/pot
                    holders, no tie blankets, and ceramic coasters made using something called alcohol ink.

            If you are looking for something special for that certian someone from crocheted afghans, potholders/hot pads to
            sock snowmen and ceramic coasters you are at the right place.

          <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
          <p class="colored">
            During the start of the pandemic in 2020 I got into keeping myself busy and got more into making different crafts
            and taught myself how to make ceramic coasters made using alcohol ink made with a resin coating to seal them.
